# Generated Columns

A generated column is a special column that is always computed from other columns. There are 2 types of generated columns:

1. Stored generated column
2. Virtual generated column


## Stored Generated Column

A stored generated column is computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a normal column.


## Virtual Generated Column

A virtual generated column occupies no storage and is computed when it is read.
